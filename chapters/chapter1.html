        <h1>Setting up your Project</h1>
        <p>Zig has many amazing ergonomic features that allow for getting started fast. The compiler has some amaing features that allow us to get going quick. Let get started by initializing a new project in zig. This can be done from the command line. After we make a new folder that we want to work in. We can then use this command.</p>
        <pre><code>
        mkdir zRogue-game
        cd zRogue-game
        zig init
        </code></pre>
        <p>With these commands zig with generate a new file. There are several important ones that we will go over. Lets look at each of them</p>
        <img src="../images/zig-init.png" alt="File structure">
        <p>After running the code above we should have a window open with the title that we gave it. How exciting! Step one is all done. The next thing we need to do is to get something rendering on that screen. Thankfully zRogue does much of the heavy lifting for us. </p>
