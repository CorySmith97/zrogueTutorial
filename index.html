        <h1>zRogue Roguelike Tutorial</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the zRogue roguelike tutorial. This is a project that is designed to give new comers to zig a fun way to become familiar with the language. In addition to learning more about zig, this aims to help make a simple project that you can be proud of.</p>

        <h3>Prerequisets</h3>

        <p>In order to get started, there are several things that you will be needing. First you need to download the zig programming language. This can be done from here <a href="https://ziglang.org/">ziglang.com</a>. Several other things include libexpoy for our rendering, and compiled copy of SDL2.</p>

        <h3>Extra Help</h3>
        <p>This tutorial expects you to understand the basics of programming. Additionally, there are topics that will not be spoken about very heavily. If you want to get a fast course introduction I highly recommend <a href="https://github.com/ratfactor/ziglings">Ziglings</a>. It is a very fast paced run through of Zig that teaches you most of the key words and 'zig' way of doing things. Additionally, if you have other questions or want to give feedback please do! You can email me at <a href="mailto: corysmith7991@gmail.com">HERE</a>.</p>
